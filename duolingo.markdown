# Flammie on *Duolingo*

Duolingo is a language learning app in 2000's. It is quite simple, in that it
only features few very basic language tests. It has mobile app and a browser
app, but I think the mobile app is the popular one and true to early 2000's it
has just got very popular indeed in a way that most people who know programming
and games just cannot easily comprehend. However, I have successfully used it
too, because, in the end, learning language is rather efficient by doing very
simple tasks repetitively and getting points and crowns and gems and high score
boards against friends along the way is a good thing.

Like I said, Duolingo has only few types of basic exercises most of which are
familiar from schoolbooks etc. At the moment there is:

1. Match word in *teaching language* (usually English, I may call this support
   language in this rant too) to word in target language *and a picture*, this
   is often first exercise to teach a new word
1. Translate a sentence, on a mobile app you have to just arrange the words in
   order, and there are few extra words to trick you. This practice goes both
   ways, first *target language* to *teaching language*
    1. On desktop version you can currently turn off this "*word bank*", and
       translate using keyboard instead; you will want to swap to this mode if
       you can
1. match words 5×2
1. listen and type (if you have audio output)
1. speak (if you have a microphone)
1. Fill in one missing word in sentence or discussion, multiple choice

Most of these are exactly what you get in text books if you studied languages at
school.

Duolingo is a for-profit company which is problematic from few aspects. It has
to prioritise customer retention over effective learning. It has to sell
*duolingo plus* and push ads. Also one of the more problematic things which I
have not thoroughly researched but heard third hand information of of is, the
courses are made by *volunteers*, who may not receive much of duolingo's profits
at all and may not have any understanding of language teaching / pedagogy, and
this is quite apparent in some courses (admittedly most bad courses are marked
*beta*). By the way if you know what kind of deal Duolingo has with course
admins I would be interested to know some details.

## Howto: use duolingo effectively

This is my method for learning languages, has worked with: *German* and
*Norwegian (Bokmål)*, both of these courses are good quality.

1. Use desktop version
    1. Use keyboard, not word bank
    1. Read the hints / grammar
1. Set goals and stick to them (50 xp per day, 14+ streak) if you need to rest
   use amulets instead of toxic mobile gaming style *checkin to do 1 xp to
   keep streak* bs that's no good for your learning
1. Don't cheat by turning off microphone and listening exercises, you need to
   learn to read, understand what is spoken to you, and to pronounce, in order
   to learn a language.
1. If something is strange, read the comments and report, there's a lot of bad
   English and wrong hints and stuff in duolingo

Some of this may change everytime duolingo changes stuff.

In the end of the day though, duolingo is just a tool to build some basic
vocab. After few weeks you'll have to start doing something on top, read the
news or watch a tv without subtitles, talk to people or such.

## Problems

Duolingo has several quite bad problems that make it less useful than it could
be. One of the biggest one is that it is mostly only available in English.
English is quite unusual language and doesn't resemble many of the languages,
for most of us it isn't a native language. Many of the exercises are translation
exercises and the system has very simple definition of correct translation; it
has a list of acceptable translations and some support for typos. If you
rephrase too much it counts as a fail. If you miss an article or use combination
of articles (that is *a* and *the*) that is not one of the "correct" ones, you
lose a point; but most languages do not have same articles or articles at all.
If you use *doing* form instead of *do* you lose a point but almost no language
besides English has this kind of -ing forms, so it's very arbitrary when the ing
forms are accepted or required. Some language courses favour having most literal
and word-to-word translations retaining all grammar, others have idiomatic; some
like Hungarian course have outright ungrammatical and unreadable "English", not
sure whether the course makers didn't really know English or tried too hard to
retain all the nuances of Hungarian there.

Because the exercises are not really ordered well, you are often listening or
writing words you haven't learnt or given the complex sentences before simple
ones. Also the themes of the exercises (in 2022 version at least) do not always
relate to the exercises you get at all, you could have like kitchen as a theme
and then have a sentence about animals in forest or whatnot, or even worse, a
grammar theme that has zero examples of the grammar topic, sometimes it seems
like someone who just misunderstood grammar really badly has put the sentences
there, like having perfect participle sentences but all examples are of English
words that kind of look perfect particple forms but are just adjecives in the
language you are learning. Furthermore, the grammar sections come unexplained
and without clarifications, even when I am a trained linguist, it is often hard
for me to comprehend what duolingo means when it teaches me "Progr. cont." or
some other cryptic thing. In the web version only, one can open an explanation
to the category, which may or may not be filled with some words from the course
maker of what they meant with the section, which may reveal how they
misunderstood this grammar topic.
