# Flammie on *Duolingo*

**NB: duolingo changes all the time so anything written here can be outdated. In
somewhere around 2023 duolingo disabled discussions and grammar notes so it's
always getting worse and less useful. Also in 2023 duolingo laid off a lot of
humans to begin to use AI to make these courses so we can only expect it to be
much much worse in near future. If you can use real courses made by professional
teachers it is usually much better than supporting duolingo. Finally, in
2024 duolingo has made free version of the app unusable, you literally cannot
continue learning after 5 mistakes unless you pay now!**

Duolingo is a language learning app in 2000's. It is quite simple, in that it
only features few very basic language exercises. It has mobile app and a browser
app, but I think the mobile app is the popular one. Being so simple and having
nothing particularly unique makes you wonder why it is so popular over anything
else really. However, I have successfully used it too, because, in the end,
learning language is rather efficient by doing very simple tasks repetitively
and getting points and crowns and gems and high score boards against friends
along the way is a good thing.

Like I said, Duolingo has only few types of basic exercises most of which are
familiar from schoolbooks etc. At the moment there is:

1. Match word in *teaching language* (usually English, I use the term *support
   language* in this rant too) to word in target language *and a picture*, this
   is often first exercise to teach a new word
1. Translate a sentence, on a mobile app you have to just arrange the words in
   order, and there are few extra words to trick you. This practice goes both
   ways, first *target language* to *teaching language*
    1. On desktop version you can currently turn off this "*word bank*", and
       translate using keyboard instead; you will want to swap to this mode if
       you can
1. match words 5×2
1. listen and type (if you have audio output)
    1. or listen and select words from the word bank
1. speak (if you have a microphone)
1. Fill in one missing word in sentence or discussion, multiple choice (also
   known as *cloze*)

Most of these are exactly what you get in text books if you studied languages at
school. There's nothing particularly creative in these exercises but they are
effective mostly. If only this app was available as open source version where
users could contribute courses and the contributed courses were also open source
and there was no pay wall to learning...


## Howto: use duolingo effectively

This is my method for learning languages, has worked with: *German* and
*Norwegian (Bokmål)*, both of these courses are good quality.

1. Use keyboard, not word bank
1. ~~Read the hints / grammar~~ Duolingo has removed most of the grammar
   notes and hints in 2023
1. Set goals and stick to them (50 xp per day, 14+ streak) if you need to rest
   use amulets instead of toxic mobile gaming style *checkin to do 1 xp to
   keep streak* bs that's no good for your learning
1. Don't cheat by turning off microphone and listening exercises, you need to
   learn to read, understand what is spoken to you, and to pronounce, in order
   to learn a language.
1. If something is strange, ~~read the comments~~ and report, there's a lot of
   bad English and wrong hints and stuff in duolingo. In 2023 duolingo has also
   removed discussions so there's no way to understand broken solutions anymore.


Some of this may change everytime duolingo changes stuff.

In the end of the day though, duolingo is just a tool to build some basic
vocab. After few weeks you'll have to start doing something on top, read the
news or watch a tv without subtitles, talk to people or such.

## Problems

Duolingo is a for-profit company which is problematic from few aspects. It has
to prioritise customer retention over effective learning. It has to sell
*~~duolingo plus~~ Super Duolingo* and push ads. If you don't pay, your studying
will literally be interrupted by a voice that says "people who pay are five
times more likely to finish their courses", how's that for putting money before
the "noble cause" of teaching people languages, literally making it worse for
free users on purpose. Duolingo is optimised for maximum profit, not maximum
learning. Every update they make is maximising user retention, not improved
language learning. This cannot be emphasised enough.

In 2024 they've also made the hearts system much more punishing and disabled any
other way to gain hearts than paying money! This means that if you make 5
mistakes you cannot continue learning unless you pay. This is of course very bad
for learning anything.

Also one of the more problematic things which I have not thoroughly researched
but heard third hand information of of is, the courses are made by *volunteers*,
who may not receive much of duolingo's profits at all and may not have any
understanding of language teaching / pedagogy, and this is quite apparent in
some courses (admittedly most bad courses are marked *beta*). By the way if you
know what kind of deal Duolingo has with course admins I would be interested to
know some details.

They have also added even more problematic way to generate endless courses for
minimum effort; in 2024 they simply just use AI to generate the content, there's
no human thought that goes into making this little exercises any more.

One huge problem for me is that Duolingo is only available in English.
English is quite unusual language and doesn't resemble many of the languages,
for most of us it isn't a native language. Many of the exercises are translation
exercises and the system has very simple definition of correct translation; it
has a list of acceptable translations and some support for typos. If you
rephrase too much it counts as a fail. If you miss an article or use combination
of articles (that is *a* and *the*) that is not one of the "correct" ones, you
lose a point; but most languages do not have same articles or articles at all.
If you use *doing* form instead of *do* you lose a point but almost no language
besides English has this kind of -ing forms, so it's very arbitrary when the ing
forms are accepted or required. Some language courses favour having most literal
and word-to-word translations retaining all grammar, others have idiomatic; some
like Hungarian course have outright ungrammatical and unreadable "English", not
sure whether the course makers didn't really know English or tried too hard to
retain all the nuances of Hungarian there.

At the moment (2024) the word bank is by default used by most exercises! This is
very problematic since it is very easy to fall back into treating the exercises
as a nearly monolingual word puzzle: *what is the only sensible sentence I can
form from these English words*. Even when you try very hard to treat it as a
translation exercise, the fact that you can only see some words but not others
will help you too much to not use your brains and memory to figure out the
actual meaning of the sentence in the foreign language.

Because the exercises are not really ordered well, you are often listening or
writing words you haven't learnt or given the complex sentences before simple
ones. Also the themes of the exercises (in 2022 version at least) do not always
relate to the exercises you get at all, you could have like kitchen as a theme
and then have a sentence about animals in forest or whatnot, or even worse, a
grammar theme that has zero examples of the grammar topic, sometimes it seems
like someone who just misunderstood grammar really badly has put the sentences
there, like having perfect participle sentences but all examples are of English
words that kind of look perfect particple forms but are just adjecives in the
language you are learning. Furthermore, the grammar sections come unexplained
and without clarifications, even when I am a trained linguist, it is often hard
for me to comprehend what duolingo means when it teaches me "Progr. cont." or
some other cryptic thing. In the web version only, one can open an explanation
to the category, which may or may not be filled with some words from the course
maker of what they meant with the section, which may reveal how they
misunderstood this grammar topic.

The system doesn't really support idioms and multiword expressions, but they pop
up in the exercises without any explanations. You can recognise this when the
correct solution has a lot of words which are not suggested when you try to
hover over words of the sentence to find single word translations. This is super
frustrating and pedagogically very terrible and outright harmful for learning.
