# Flammie on *Duolingo*

Duolingo is a language learning app in 2000's. It is quite simple, in that it
only features few very basic language tests. It has mobile app and a browser
app, but I think the mobile app is the popular one and true to early 2000's it
has just got very popular indeed in a way that most people who know programming
and games just cannot easily comprehend. However, I have successfully used it
too, because, in the end, learning language is rather efficient by doing very
simple tasks repetitively and getting points and crowns and gems and high score
boards against friends along the way is a good thing.

Like I said, Duolingo has only few types of basic exercises most of which are
familiar from schoolbooks etc. At the moment there is:

1. Match word in *teaching language* (usually English, I may call this support
   language in this rant too) to word in target language *and a picture*, this
   is often first exercise to teach a new word
1. Translate a sentence, on a mobile app you have to just arrange the words in
   order, and there are few extra words to trick you. This practice goes both
   ways, first *target language* to *teaching language*
    1. On desktop version you can currently turn off this "*word bank*", and
       translate using keyboard instead; you will want to swap to this mode if
       you can
1. match words 5×2
1. listen and type (if you have audio output)
1. speak (if you have a microphone)
1. Fill in one missing word in sentence or discussion, multiple choice

Most of these are exactly what you get in text books if you studied languages at
school.

Duolingo is a for-profit company which is problematic from few aspects. It has
to prioritise customer retention over effective learning. It has to sell
*duolingo plus* and push ads. Also one of the more problematic things which I
have not thoroughly researched but heard third hand information of of is, the
courses are made by *volunteers*, who may not receive much of duolingo's profits
at all and may not have any understanding of language teaching / pedagogy, and
this is quite apparent in some courses (admittedly most bad courses are marked
*beta*).

## Howto: use duolingo effectively

This is my method for learning languages, has worked with: *German* and
*Norwegian (Bokmål)*, both of these courses are good quality.

1. Use desktop version
    1. Use keyboard, not word bank
    1. Read the hints / grammar
1. Set goals and stick to them (50 xp per day, 14+ streak) if you need to rest
   use amulets instead of toxic mobile gaming style *checkin to do 1 xp to
   keep streak* bs that's no good for your learning
1. Don't cheat by turning off microphone and listening exercises, you need to
   learn to read, understand what is spoken to you, and to pronounce, in order
   to learn a language.

Some of this may change everytime duolingo changes stuff.
