# Flammie's Swedish to Norwegian translator

I learnt Finland's Swedish (finlandsvenska, a variant of Swedish spoken with
Finnish phoneme set and few minor variations) in school but work daily with
Norwegian these days, in general of course my Swedish wasn't too good but here's
how I translate between them in my head usually. This is of course interesting
for my RBMT work and linguistics as well. I also need to reverse this when I
visit sweden to speak understandable *skandinavisk*.

| stänger | lukker | close |
| disk | oppvask | dishes (Fin: *tiski*) |

| tjej | jenta | girl, gal |
| tjenare | hallais | informal greetingses |

Most of the Swedish words are more or less understood in Norway, sometimes with
more or less specific restrictions, e.g. instead of *eat* it might be
*masticate* or something (based on [s.v. ete in bokmål
ordbok](https://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=ete&bokmaal=+&ordbok=bokmaal).
