# Flammie's Swedish to Norwegian translator

I learnt Finland's Swedish (finlandsvenska, a variant of Swedish spoken with
Finnish phoneme set and few minor variations) in school but work daily with
Norwegian these days, in general of course my Swedish wasn't too good but here's
how I translate between them in my head usually. This is of course interesting
for my RBMT work and linguistics as well.

| Swedish | Norwegian bokmål |
| :------ | :--------------- |
| minner | husker |
| pratar | snakker |
| ätar | spiser |
| jag | jeg |
| mycket | mye |
| ... | veldig |
| översätning | øversettelse |
| -ing | -else |
| börjär | begynner |
| gillar | liker |
| skillnad | forskjell |
| jätte- | kjempe- |
| svårt | vanskelig |


## Norwegian dialects

In Tromsø there is an extra level of dialect you must observe (lik everywhere in
Norway, I guess bokmål is like a district in Oslo), here's a post-processering
table:

| Bokmål | Tromsø |
| :----- | :----- |
| jeg | æ |
| meg | mæ |
| hvordan | korsjn |
| hvad | ka |
| ni | dåkker |
