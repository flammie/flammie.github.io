Traditionally I would've told everyone to use email for 99 % of things or
IRC for real time discussions and it was good enough.

This was a good standard but has been breaking down as of late. Ironically, in
times of where we are most reachable, most online, I have much less capability
or possibility to actually respond than I used to. Things have become less
reliable, more full of spam, and fair and square less usable than before.

To explain a bit more I wrote this page. The main point I have is that I am
theoretically reachable online most of the time, but need to protect myself from
distractions when working in flow state for example. I have compiled a list of
features that communication channels have that are relevant:

* *leaves a record*, so I do not have to memorise things
* *interrupts*, if it requires immediate action such as answering when being
  called (also: push/pull)
* ...

## Email

Email used to be the obvious ideal choice, but recently we have been forced to
use sub-optimal email systems: both microsoft and google are locking us to their
products with multifactor authentication that doesn't play with other email
clients. The spam filtering is done by them, badly. This means I miss a lot of
mails, and cannot reply properly since I only have access to web page with no
quote feature and forced top posting. Email does not interrupt me in flow state,
I can setup notifications and pull interval. Email leaves perfect record of the
conversation and if people *inline post* all, it's easy to follow, but that's a
lost battle now I suppose.

## Note about messengers and social media and notifications

I do not have my mobile phone on me at all times and I have disabled **all**
notifications. I read my messages when I get to them, I will not be interrupted
by a telephone. It may take several days for me to notice a message in Signal,
WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook Messgenger.
