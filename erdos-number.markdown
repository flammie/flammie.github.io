# Flammie's Erdős Number

[Erdős number]() is the collaboration chain distance to mathematician Paul
Erdős. Since we are not mathematicians, many calculators won't give clear
answer, but sometimes there is an overlap via formal language theory for
example. Here are some paths I have found for number 6:

1. Paul Erdős
1. Norbert W. Sauer
1. Manfred Droste
1. Heiko Vogler
1. Mark-Jan Nederhof
1. Anssi Yli-Jyrä
1. Me

1. Paul Erdős
1. Krishnaswami Alladi
1. Anthony G. Shannon
1. Stoyan Mihov
1. Jan Daciuk
1. Mikel L. Forcada
1. Me

A bit of creativity will also give:

1. Paul Erdős
1. Marcel Erné
1. Branimir Šešelja
1. Andreas Maletti
1. Joakim Nivre
1. Me

or probably even better but large collaborations on resource papers might be a
bit of a cheating?
