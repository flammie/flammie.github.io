# Flammie on things and stuff

I use this github page section to collect all kinds of opinion pieces, essays,
just any kind of writings that do not fit into social media or other places I
post stuff into (e.g. [reviews](/reviews-everything/)). Perhaps if it was 1990s
or first decade of 2000s this would be a blog site. These may be
work-in-progress, this whole site is 50-50 for me to dump my brains onto vs.
actually providing answers and information to people on interesting things. I
have found that unless I write down some of these thoughts that I have in my
mind they will keep bothering my concentration (unless I debate about the topic
with my colleagues or friends).

This seems very unorganised lol.

  This is like my old blogs and "home pages". They are similar rants
  like abovementioned, just way older and immaturer.
