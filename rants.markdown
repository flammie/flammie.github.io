* Maybe also check [flammie.dyndns.org archives](archive/index.html),
  some of the pages I written in the early years of the internet, 
  some found from the internet archive some actually just saved over the years.
  This is like my old blogs and "home pages". They are similar rants 
  like abovementioned, just way older and immaturer.
