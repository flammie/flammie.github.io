# Flammie on things and stuff

I use this github page section to collect all kinds of opinion pieces, essays,
just any kind of writings that do not fit into social media or other places I
post stuff into (e.g. [reviews](/reviews-everything/)). Perhaps if it was 1990s
or first decade of 2000s this would be a blog site. These may be
work-in-progress, this whole site is 50-50 for me to dump my brains onto vs.
actually providing answers and information to people on interesting things. I
have found that unless I write down some of these thoughts that I have in my
mind they will keep bothering my concentration (unless I debate about the topic
with my colleagues or friends). In 2020s I also post these or summaries thereof
onto [my substack](https://flammie.substack.com/).

This seems very unorganised lol.

  like abovementioned, just way older and immaturer.
