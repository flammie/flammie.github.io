# Flammie on my English (and foreign languages in general)

I am not a native speaker of English, and that much should be obvious from
reading or listening to me. I am, however, a computational linguists and I
recognise my mistakes as I make them, and they are interesting. Here is an open
listing of hwat I discovered. There are few very places where I specifically
make note of the limits of my English:

1. just speaking, I know some sounds and when I miss them like an artist after
   playing wrong note for sure.
1. Duolingo, since Duolingo is X-English for languages I learn, and it is very
   insisten on specific, usually grammatically most correct, versions, just
   missing a definite article or adding one won't do.
    1. (There are exceptions to this, of course, since Duolingo is done by
       "voluntary" slave work, e.g. the English in Hungarian course is so bad it
        cannot be considered English)
1. [*Academic English*](academic-english.html), very rarely the feedback does
   also explicitly point out specific shortcomings of my writings.

## Pronunciation

My native language is Finnish, and like many people, I do not have a good skill
in pronouncing foreing sounds. I know few people who can do that, but generally,
people are stuck to the sounds of their native languages, unless really
concentrating. Pronounciations can be easily compared:


| English | Finnish   |
|---------|-----------|
| ɑ       | ɑ         |
| ʌ       | *a*       |
| b       | *p*       |
| d       | d (t)     |
| dʒ      | *ds* (ts) |
| e       | e         |
| ə       | *e*       |
| ɜ       | *e*       |
| f       | f (v)     |
| g       | *k*       |
| h       | h         |
| x       | x         |
| ɪ       | *i*       |
| iː      | i         |
| j       | j         |
| kʰ      | *k*       |
| l       | l         |
| m       | m         |
| n       | n         |
| ŋ       | ŋ         |
| ɔ       | *o*       |
| pʰ      | *p*       |
| r       | *R*       |
| s       | s         |
| ʃ       | *s*       |
| tʰ      | *t*       |
| θ       | *t*       |
| ð       | *t*       |
| ʊ       | *u*       |
| u       | u         |
| v       | v         |
| w       | *v*       |
| z       | *s*       |
| ʒ       | *s*       |
| æ       | æ         |
| ə       | ø         |

It really depends on the listener what they tolerate and understand, but I am
gonna mention more closely few specific examples I am constantly aware.

### Stops: K, p, t, g, b and d

For me one of the easiest way to catch bad Finnish accent, including my own, is
to listen to consonants called stops, that is k, p, t, g, b, and d.
Historically, Finnish only has k, p and t, while modern loan words have brought
g, b and d to Finnish, the pronunciation varies and does not match English at
all. In English k sound can be told apart from g sound by aspiration, in
carefully pronounced Finnish k is not aspirated but g is kind of voiced. The
same happens to p and b and to certain extent with t and d, although the last
pair is slightly different because it has existed in Finnish as an opposing pair
the longest. What this really means, is that when I am not pronouncing
carefully, there is often no notable difference between, say, cot and got, pot
and bot or tot and dot. Even more so, the latter of each pair will definitely
sound like former for those who do not expect foreigner pronunciation, the most
prominent example of this is my christening name: *Tommi*. If I pronounce it in
Finnish way, most people will write down *Dom* or *Dominic* of some sort. To
make sure I am understood I have to pronounce it in a way that to me is very
exaggeratedly aspirated: *T-hhh-ommmei*, but then, it will be mostly written as
*Tommy* in the papers. Oh well.

### Sibilants: s, z, and sh and some zh

There is no sh sound in Finnish. Also no z and no zh. However, I have a feeling
that Finnish s's wander between s and sh and are generally less foreign
sounding, or maybe there is enough variation in world Englishes that this does
not sound so unusual. But it is important to notice that when I am not
pronouncing carefully, I do not make different sounds pronouncing sit and shit,
for example. Same problem applies to all z's and zh's, they all mix together but
they are so much rarer that they are not so bothersome and also easier to
remember to make an effort to prnounce carefully, I will rarely pronounce zeroes
llike sheroes or some such.

As a side note, while Finnish does not have z, it is mainly known from succh
italian loans as *pizza* and proncounced like ch, so it would not be unusual for
me to pronounce *zebra* like it was spelled *cheapra*.

### Interdental fricatives like th

Yes, Finnish does not have th sounds of any kind. It is just a t sound. That
sounds very jarring to other Finnish speakers, however, since this is not
uncommon in world's Englishes, certainly Irish English has almost exactly same
feature, a ot of people understand very well if I pronounce three like tree.

### Vowels altogether

Finnish has 8 vowel sounds and English at least 11, they do not overlap neatly
so when Finns pronounce English chaos ensues. This is also where Finnish
tendency to associate letters with sounds shows up strongly, it is rather hard
for a finn to understand that *though a tough cough without a thought* has ou
five times it has different vowel in the words each time. Also with like *cat*
and *cart*. Of course most fun is to know that vowel in *read* and *read* is
different as well. As a final hit, words that seem to start with vowel but have
consonant are really hard for me: *university* I start to pronounce like *un* in
*uncool* and *Euro-*words like *eeww* (or a diphthong sound *eu* from Finnish
that really doesn't exist in English).

This is probably less noticeable for English speakers than you might think, the
variation is so huge between dialects. E.g. if you browse through wikipedia for
English phonology you run into articles like [cot–caught
merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger) and
[Father–bother
 merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_open_back_vowels#Father%E2%80%93bother_merger).
Another fine xample is Irish u in pub, Dublin or even bus is rather closer to
Finnish u than English u in those words.

## beau etc.

One thing that I will often miss if not concentrating is the */j/* sound in
words like *beautiful*, so it turns out like *bootiful*. This sound actually
appears a lot more in English than you'd think:

## Different words and grammars

Monolingual people will often wonder if people proficient in languages have to
think what they say in native language and translate it in their heads, I think
for me the answer in English is a bit of that and a bit of natively speaking.
For some words and structures I think my English will sound idiomatic without
efforts but when something goes weird the underlying problem is often a too
direct translation.

Finnish and English grammars are quite far apart, when speaking spontaneously
and without thinking it is not unusual to mix word orders and ignore other
differences.

### Gendered pronouns

There's none in Finnish, I need to be very conscious of gendering to produce
*he* or *she* correctly, I developed a habit of overusing singular *they* way
before it became common, i.e. even in sentences where context already has
gendered other things.

### Articles

There's none of this *the*, *a*, *an* nonsense in Finnish and the rules of using
them in English is wildly arbitrary and illogical, I do not use them
systematically at all. It usually mostly matters in writing though, in speaking
ignoring or adding articles is so easily overlooked that people generally do not
mind.

### Adpositions

Adpositions are used in English for two different things that are very
unintuitive for non-native speaker. The more concrete use is to mainly indicate
locations and sometimes directions: *in*, *at* and *on* are particularly
confusables for many cases. There is not very strong logic behind the difference
of *at the airport*, *at home*, *in school*, *in Sweden* etc., you can always
try and come up with rationalisations but the problem is, other languages
selected differently and their speakers also insist they are logical with good
reasonings. This is not a case that usually hinders underestanding, so it is
naturally ignored in real world use a lot. Some people might even say there's a
difference between *in the airport* and *at the airport*, but the reality of
this kind of language use is, is if you do intend to make such difference, it is
lost on majority of your readers / listeners.

The second arbitrary use case of adpositions is in so-called *phrasal verb
constructions*, here the adposition is kind of tacked on afters some verb to
make totally new verb, for example: *fuck up* has not much to do with copulating
and definetely nothng with direction up. I feel like I have learnt these more
systematically than the adpositions of places though, apart from such edge cases
like *write down* ~ *write up* which is kind of inverse of the Finnish idiom, I
don't often mistake the things here then.

I should note that the mistakes I make can stack up, like today, I meant
something like *they met **at the** restaurant*, but said *they met **in a**
restaurant*, does the meaning change, did the listeners get what I meant, I'm
not really sure.

### Mismatching words

Contrary to popular belief, words rarely translate 1:1 between languages, for
most words it can be quite near but more often than not it is not. For example,
one common thing I will say is either like "Germany is difficult, we should go
French" like, the names of languages and countries in Finnish are 99 % the same,
I am not consciously aware of the difference all the time. It is btw the same
phenomenon when I mix up he and she, because there is no distinction in my
language I do not keep the distinction in my active memory when talking and
blurt out random choice.

A lot of words, especially adjectives, occupy a part of scale or such a space,
which is never a direct match but like 80 % overlap here and there. For example,
the words *possibly*, *probably*, *surely*, *certainly*, etc, occupy a slice on
the likelihood scale, which is not at all the same slice as their Finnish
counterparts, so there will be a lot of suspicious usage for any foreign
language speakers. It is also next to impossible to know for sure which of these
words convey negative attitudes, ignorance or dismissal for a non-native
speaker. Just to keep in mind.
