# Flammie on pronouns

This is just a short note on usage of personal pronouns as related to
contemporary English and social situations and gender identity. There will be
larger rants on other parts of this site on the linguistics of pronoun as a
part-of-speech. I traditionally used he/him as my pronouns but are increasingly
describing my preference as he/him/they/them where possible. This is to be taken
as I have never acted particularly masculine social role but rather taken
whatever I prefer whenever, you know, aesthetically speaking I just want to wear
my makeup and skirts when I feel like it and all that.

I also have no gendered pronouns in my native language and if I speak English it
requires extra step for my brain to generate a personal pronoun and if I'm tired
or drunk it will go wrong more often than not, I can only apologise for that, I
mean no disrespect of course.
