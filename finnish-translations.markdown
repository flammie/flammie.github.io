# Flammieâ€™s Finnish translations

I have translated several open source software to Finnish, there is also a short
list of [common translation gotchas in Finnish](finnish-translator-notes.html)
on the web site for reference. This list is not super actively kept up-to-date
but just to get an idea:

* mutt
* pan (until 2015-ish / death of usenet ;-)
* vim
* claws-mail (until 2019?)
* grip
