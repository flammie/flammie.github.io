# Flammie’s collection of potential cognates, loans and somesuch

*WIP*

This page is just another collection of interesting things I noticed learning
languages, cognates and loans probably, some might be accidental similarities.
I have not researched the backgrounds of these, they are just educated guesses.
I only collect word pairs and groups that seem interesting, not everything I
see, e.g. *internet* will not be in the list even though it naturally is
copied from the same source in 99 % of the world languages. I might make another
list automatedly later though.

## Pineapple

Pineapple is funny because it's practically only English that has it like that
and all others went with *ananas*. And pineapple is of course quite ridiculous
itself.

## Milkery

¹ milkery as in dairy processing place thing, can be called dairy but is more
ambiguous.

Yeah I picked this one up since *-eri* in Finnish sounds like a native suffix
for doing stuff, so I was surprised to find it in non-Finnish, but I should of
guessed *\*meijata* is not a word.

## Ocean

This is fun because *valta* in *valtameri* can mean mass or power but seeing the
German word it looks equally plausible to have been borrowed from that. Not sure
what etymologists think atm though.

## Parrot

This is another funny one, since *papu* in *papukaija* is Finnish for bean, you
don't initially think it's just a corruption in borrowing but funny native
coined word.

## Shark

German has brought many borrowings that are surprisingly Finnish sounding words
in the animal kingdom, *hai* being one of them. See also [Life of Sharks fact
622 (on Instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYG9_eiM5Ak/).

## Possible

² I wonder if *mahtaa* has same origins though.

## Sword

Miekka to мец is not super likely but it looked neatly similar :-)

## Glue


## Stuff

Just because ‘stuff’ is my favourite word, and in germanic it gets used in a lot
of compounds, and the Norwegian *tøy* looks like English ‘toy’ but it's not the
right cognate (‘toy’ is *leketøy*)... it is possible that English ’toy' is a
shortening of Norwegian or dutch toy.
