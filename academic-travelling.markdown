# Flammie on Academic travelling

I'm not gonna lie, travelling is also a hobby of mine and getting to do some for
work is great fun. That being said, the way academic travelling is organised is
quite horrible so far (2000â€“2022). I have been in numerous positions in half a
dozen of universities in half a dozen countries in Europe, and while I'm
grateful they do pay their part of travel bill eventually, it is organised in
quite bad manner that wastes everyone's time and effort, and can easily be
prohibitive to people from backgrounds where they simply cannot have extra stash
of two three months of salary available. This is combination of:

1. travel billing / tracking systems
1. forced to use specific "travel agents"
1. pay first, get refunded (months) later
