# Flammie on understanding world Englishes as non-native speaker

As English is de facto standard language of the world most of us understand and
use it daily at the level that might be considered fluent by some, however, it
has some significant caveats. One of the things is that it surprises native
speakers a lot when we do not know some word or expression despite being quite
fluent or get it wrong, this happens most often when e.g. British and US
English disagree.
