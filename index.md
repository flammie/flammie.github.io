# Flammie.github.io

This is a personal github pages site for [Flammie on
github](https://github.com/flammie).

For the following github projects I also have gh-pages branches:

* [Open morphology of Finnish](omorfi/)
* [Research papers](purplemonkeydishwasher/) (academic papers’ tex files, bib
  files and a CV / publication list)
* [Flammie’s Dotfiles](dotfiles/) (it is, the configuration files)

The [Apertium](//apertium.github.io)-based projects are now under apertium
github pages:

* [Apertium Finnish dictionary (derived from
  omorfi)](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin/)
* [Apertium Finnish–English resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-deu/)
* [Apertium Finnish–German resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-eng/)
* [Apertium Finnish–Norwegian resources](//apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-nor/)

Here is also a section for [essays, rants and such writeups](rants.html), where
I write things that are not quite well-formulated enough for academic short
papers even but longer than tweets, you could call them blog posts but they kind
of lack the temporal concept of blog postings somehow...

# Flammie

* [Academic stuff](purplemonkeydishwasher/)
  * You can search some of my academic papers under my old name *Tommi Pirinen*

* **Pronunciation:**
  * Native Finnish pronunciations is
  ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet))
  ['fla.mːi.e],
  * theoretically origin is japanese フラミー (Furamī, so
  ['fɾa.mi:]), but
  * you can also anglicise freely, e.g. [fleɪmɪ] is perfectly acceptable.
  * I'm afraid the surname is not easily understandable in
  foreign accent, if you need to pronounce the surname for some reason like
  introduction at an academic event, try ['pi.Ri,nen] (yeah Finnish
  orthography is relatively modern and phonemic, and matches the IPA
  transcription quite well)
