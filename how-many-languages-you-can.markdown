# Flammie on how many languages you can speak?

Whether joking or serious (and possibly naïve), being a linguist you get asked
often how many languages you can speak or understand. Among linguists this is
often taken as a joke, of course since linguistics has to do with the theory of
the languages rather than practical use of it, it is entirely possible to be
monolingual and decent linguist; this is parallel to e.g. computer science and
programming, for theoretical computer scientist or even software engineer it is
not necessary to use multiple programming languages daily. There is a point to
this question however, since it is very much beneficial to study of languages'
structures and shape, to understand and be able to use as many as possible
languages from differen families. To this extent I am sometimes overly
wary of linguists who are monolinguals (e.g. from USA) or struggle with
English as their only foreign language (e.g. German, French, Russian and
Spanish etc. speakers who can barely write and communicate in English).

But anyways, to answer the question you do need to determine what it means to be
able to speak or understand language. Commonly in language learning, the system
of A1---C3 is used, where A1 is able to say *hello my name is* and C3 discuss on
range of topics from politics to their field of expertise... or something like
that I haven't really bothered to look it up. Personally, when I answer this
question, I use a variation that is relevant to my interests:

1. Can not speak or understand (may recognise language/script/keywords)
1. Can order a beer or two in a pub, a portion of food, check in to a hotel and
   understand some basic signage, menus and stuff (A1-A2?)
1. Can discuss basics, family, places, weather and lots of stuff really, with
   constant vocabulary limitations and problems, read quite well with limited
   use of a dictionary (B?)
1. Can discuss any themes and topics with rare need to work around missing
   words (C)
1. Near-native such that with effort can pass as local unless strong accent is
   preventing that (not all of us can learn to pronounce foreign languages), may
   still miss words and phrases where some native speakers (fishes, farm tools,
   what have yous)

The question of which you count as being able to speak is the question, for if
you limit it to level 5, I can maybe only Finnish and English, for 4 it would be
half a dozen and level 2 a lot more:

1. Most languages?
1. Hungarian, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, Czech, Russian, Karelian,
   Estonian, Irish...?
1. Swedish, French
1. Norwegian, German
1. Finnish, English

Conceivably, level 2 is reachable after few weeks~months with duolingoing and
writing a translation dictionary plus transfer grammars. In other words, most
summer schools, winter schools or researcher visits would be enough to learn the
usable basics, that's really all that is required, for me at least, and I'd be
tempted to say it's mostly motivation plus effort, I do not consider myself
particularly talented with language learning.

*It must be said though*, most of what follows about learning and using the
language only applies to well-resourced majority languages, that is. mostly
languages that are native to a country. For minority languages, you probably do
not get a duolingo app, or a bar or hotel staff using it. For many minority
languages just finding place to use it may require an extra effort.

I saw this video after writing this but it's quite relevant too: [Abroad

## Level 0: recognising languages

I acknowledge well that being a language nerd and a linguist means that I may
know few things more of all languages than an average person (c.f. [this xkcd
comic about average familiarity](https://xkcd.com/2501/)), however, I think
most, maybe top few %, languages are in category where I can guess from a text
what it is. Very basic computer programs can do it too, nowadays if you copy
paste random strings to google translate it will recognise languages kind of.
There's nothing strange there, just looking at distribution of characters, word
lenghts, affixes etc. There's nothing much that I have learnt from them in this
category, associating cyrillics to certain set of languages and Kanji to other
is not a linguistic skill.

## Level 1: touristic use

This is what I believe a good tourist should aim for visiting in foreign
countries, it is just good manners to know and recognise everyday communication.
And learning it is not a huge effort: duolingo will usually start with these
phrases and words, lonely planets smallest size phrasebooks (or free ones from
the internet if you cannot get one) are perfect supplement to that. Here's the
phrases you want:

> * Hello
> * Does this bus go to city center?
> * Thanks
> * Bye
> * I have a reservation for 3 nights
> * I pay by card¹ (contactless)
> * Here you go
> * One beer please
> * Can I have one food please *pointing*
> * I'm going to this hotel please

¹I don't even know how to say this in English sounding like a normal person
`-_-`

IT's always the same. Plus all the things that you see in potential atms and
public transport machines, toilet doors and such. Definitely learnable in a week
or two, plus if you just pay attention to what people around you do and say when
in country.


## Level 2: Discuss and struggle

This is the actual learner phase, when you actually start seriously learning
and using language, most often after moving to a country for the first few
years. It's mostly about vocabulary gathering at this time. Though the actual
first thing you start this phase with is learning basics of discussion that
annoyingly are not taught in classes or learn books, that is, how to discuss
like a good foreigner, here's the phrases you need:

> * What is this in *this language* (again) *pointing and gesturing*
> * What was that word you said *foreign word*, is it something about *stuffs*
> * Um, it's like, you know
> * Gotcha, yeah, oh I know
> * innit, no way, for real
> * ...

There's loads, the main point is that for learning by doing to go smoothly the
first thing to learn is to how to keep discussion flowing, especially when you
are missing a word. There's another use of learning to explain things a bit;
when you are asked questions and you don't know all the words, it's a kind of a
confirmation that you understood, or if you didn't you just changed the topic
for whatever reason: "so, if I was to pick a *favourite colour* in a board
game,..." "No Karen, we were discussing of spirit animals not colours!", and
that's how it is.

## Level 3: Getting there

## Level 4: Natives don't know anything either

I like to see this level as when you can actually follow a gameshow centred on
wordplays, or a stand-up comedy, a news satire or similar. This is where you of
course start to see limits of the native language understanding as well.
Gameshows with words in focus for example are my favourite, like *pointless*
will among UK politicians and reality show stars often ask rare elements,
animals or just words from letters. *Lingo* was a whole gameshow based on
wordle, way before wordle.
