# Flammie on how many languages you can speak?

Whether joking or serious (and possibly na√Øve), being a linguist you get asked
often how many languages you can speak or understand. Among linguists this is
often taken as a joke, of course since linguistics has to do with the theory of
the languages rather than practical use of it, it is entirely possible to be
monolingual and decent linguist; this is parallel to e.g. computer science and
programming, for theoretical computer scientist or even software engineer it is
not necessary to use multiple programming languages daily. There is a point to
this question however, since it is very much beneficial to study of languages'
structures and shape, to understand and be able to use as many as possible
languages from differen families. To this extent I am sometimes overly
wary of linguists who are monolinguals (e.g. from USA) or struggle with
English as their only foreign language (e.g. German, French, Russian and
Spanish etc. speakers who can barely write and communicate in English).

But anyways, to answer the question you do need to determine what it means to be
able to speak or understand language. Commonly in language learning, the system
of A1---C3 is used, where A1 is able to say *hello my name is* and C3 discuss on
range of topics from politics to their field of expertise... or something like
that I haven't really bothered to look it up. Personally, when I answer this
question, I use a variation that is relevant to my interests:

1. Can not speak or understand (may recognise language/script/keywords)
1. Can order a beer or two in a pub, a portion of food, check in to a hotel and
   understand some basic signage, menus and stuff (A1-A2?)
1. Can discuss basics, family, places, weather and lots of stuff really, with
   constant vocabulary limitations and problems, read quite well with limited
   use of a dictionary (B?)
1. Can discuss any themes and topics with rare need to work around missing
   words (C)
1. Near-native such that with effort can pass as local unless strong accent is
   preventing that (not all of us can learn to pronounce foreign languages), may
   still miss words and phrases but so to native speakers (fishes, farm tools,
   what have yous)

The question of which you count as being able to speak is the question, for if
you limit it to level 5, I can maybe only Finnish and English, for 4 it would be
half a dozen and level 2 a lot more:

1. Most languages?
1. Hungarian, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, Czech, Russian, Karelian,
   Estonian, Irish...?
1. Swedish, French
1. Norwegian, German
1. Finnish, English

Conceivably, level 2 is reachable after few weeks~months with duolingoing and
writing a translation dictionary plus transfer grammars.
