# Flammie on *toxicity* and *toxic X-ity*

If you are generation X or older, you probably cringe at terms like *toxic
masculinity* or whatever. I am myself an elder millennial and it took me quite a
long time to figure it out as well. But I figured out there is some logic to the
concept, and I just realised it again after reading this tweet on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="fi" dir="ltr">Äsken Espalla huomautin

This is in Finnish, and it is a starter to a thread. It goes, freely translating
“I just said (on a street in Helsinki) to a younger female that their bikes lock
had fallen dangerously close to the the spokes, ‘who the fuck asked you
anything’ she answered--fair enough, nobody, but here's a thread about unasked
advice”. And I believe people from many countries and even places in Finland
outside Helsinki do not understand how common and how *toxic* this kind of
behaviour is. It immediately brought to my mind the time when in a supermarket
in Helsinki I told another customer she forgot an item in their basket, “God
these fucking freaks” was her reply to her friend, obviously loud enough for me
to hear, with eye rolls. And it is a very common thing to happen, when you are
trying to be helpful, in Helsinki. I also remember university cafeteria, a
student organisation clubhouse, whether trying to hold the door open, pick up
dropped items, it is basically treated as not minding your own business when you
do this kind of stuff. And when you get told often enough that your help is not
wanted or good, you will 1) stop helping other people at all and, 2) start
telling people that try to help you the same thing "you idiot", and it is with
the part 2 why the term toxicity is quite accurate indeed, it's a negative
behavioural pattern that is infectious and spreads fast.

And because I was 20–30 years old when living in Helsinki, it took me a couple
of years abroad, to realise this is not a common human behaviour to avoid
helping people, and almost a decade later to realise how strongly I avoid
helping anyone due to these experiences, and this is where toxicity is actually
quite accurate term to describe what happens. I don't think you never stop
expecting someone lashing back at you for opening a door or picking up a dropped
fruit when you've dealt with it for your whole 20-somethings's, or maybe it's
just me. Just, something to think about if you have a Finnish friend who you
insist is being rude to you (though I have attested same patterns in Paris, New
York etc.).

* * *

The more I think about this the more I realise the vast amount of toxic patterns
that have affected my life and behaviour, and attitudes. I think I am going to
use this page to list my observations and categorise them a bit, it might be
useful for future me and maybe someone else too! The rest of the rant is
organised as follows:

1. about being helpful vs. minding your own business
1. about gays and pride I guess
1. about giving up humour
1. about music

## Minding your own business

Also the example I gave in the intro, that made me think about the whole
toxicity to begin with.

## Other gays ruin my reputation

There is another term in modern discourse that older people might react
negatively, *internalised homophobia*, when I finally made connection between
toxicity and this it was a real light bulb moment. This pattern is probably
familiar to at least most gays of my generation or older, growing up you tend to
realise that the contemporarily popular camp gay stereotype isn't appealing to
you or relatable. Growing up you generally end up fighting against it one way or
other. Where toxicity steps in is that this attitude finds a lot of positive
response within alt-right, incel etc. communities, you even become "one of the
good gays". This attitude is also rather infectious as it gets mild approval
within neutrally aligned crowds: of course the camp stereotype are annoying and
evil, let's make fun of them and blame them. But it doesn't work like that cause
it doesn't end there, hate and disgust like that has no limits and it'll reach
back to you, why wouldn't it.

The problem here is that the starting point was such a logical fallacy to begin
with: these guys *ruin my reputation* because everyone makes fun of them, and I
am associated to them, I'll solve it by making fun of them too?  Yeah, that's
not gonna work. The only workable solution is to fight against the making fun of
and everyone wins, you'll quite likely will stand on stronger grounds in your
own self-image afterwards as well, there won't be any arbitrary and artificial
limits to be afraid of; even if it is 99 % not relevant. Yes, the crux of the
problem is poor self-confidence and self-image which is very tightly tangled
vicious circle here. But when you grow out of it and break free it's hard not to
wonder how dumb it was, like literally shooting yourself in the foot and
wondering why it hurts. I mean let's face it, the only way to have a future
where you have gay representation that is not camp in the popular culture is to
not ake fun of all this... for a moment in early 2000's it seemed like this is
where we heading at with gen z but there is a chance we're regressing now at
2020's? Time will tell.

I believe this has similarities with overall toxic masculinity and other such
phenomena that have not been very relevant in my life overall.

## Your sense of humour is lame

The one about sense of humour and taste in music are related to me by my time in
Helsinki again, here the source of toxicity is also the only group of peers and
friends I had there, this also took years of being away and then meeting them
afterwards to realise. But also this is the attitude of internet discussions of
my generations by large strokes. Telling someone that their joke is *old*,
that's where it all starts at.

## Your music taste is crap
