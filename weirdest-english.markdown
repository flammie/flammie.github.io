# Flammie lists: weirdest English pronunciations

This is just another informal listing of things I've found interesting, this
time it's English writing system versus pronunciation, a favourite topic for
many language enthusiasts. No long descriptions here but might write a separate
writeup later.

| written like | sounds like | in IPA |
|:-------------|:------------|:-------|
| jewellery | juwry | /ˈdʒuːəlɹi/, /ˈdʒuːlɹi/ |
| queue | kyew |  /kjuː/ |
