# Flammie on using flags to mean languages

This is a thing I remember discussing about in 1990's in the *Usenet* news, the
internet forum of choice back in the day. It was a common topic to debate in
the web authoring groups, I think we quite systematically decided that flags as
symbols of languages is a bad idea.  One of the more popular writings of the
time is [Flags as a symbol of language – stupidity or
insult](https://jkorpela.fi/flags.html) by J. Korpela, a prolific Usenet writer
and book author, etc. The fact that we had a consensus on how bad idea this was
in 1990s, makes it ever so much more annoying that we still face the issue in
2021. And it is not few uninformed individuals making the mistake, it is
[highly respected computational linguists studying language typology who should
know better](https://universaldependencies.org/).

## The mistakes

1. Flag is symbol of country not language
1. The relation between flags and languages is of course not 1:1, but can
   be n:m for any values of n, m including 0.
1. If the pure logicaö inaccuracy of the mismatches above is not enough,
   it is often rude or offensive to use a certain flag with some languages
   for some subset of the language speakers and their cultures. Flags
   are symbols of countries and typically political

Let us study some examples:

1. English is spoken as official language in dozens of countries, if we
   used the logic that gets used in minority language flags,
   * it would be ok to flag all English corpora with flags of
   🇦🇬 🇧🇸 🇧🇧 🇧🇿 🇧🇼 🇧🇳
   (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Botswana or Brunei, i.e.
   the alphabetically first countries with English as official langauge)
   * or how about 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 (English flag)
   * or 🇦🇪 (flag of UAE)?
1. Minority languages (i.e. not national languages) are often spoken in
   number of countries perhaps along border regions, with some or all host
   countries having rather sub-optimal language politics, having your
   language to be marked with flag of such entity is quite bad
   * perhaps languages in India and Pakistan or China and nearby
   territories for example (again, I am not good in history / politics /
   geopolitics, there probably are better examples)
1. Even non-minority languages can be part of (political) fights where all
   relevant flags will offend some of the language users
   * this happens just as well with flags of the USA and Great Britain,
   see also Republic of Ireland
   * Spanish and Portugese in South America
1. Some languages have number of semi-official flags that are tangled with
   political issues,
   * e.g. I have written some corpus material in Karelian
   languages and choice can be between Russian flag for Karelian Republic or
   flag of East Karelia (or just Russian or Finnish flag of course),
   I am not politically savvy enough to decide and I see language activists use
   both
