# Flammie on Finnish language and culture shocks

This rant has probably at leats
two goals: to make you understand my behaviour, faux pas, and
reactions and help you not to confuse me or other finns or even others from
non-anglosphere cultures. It's probably also just funny stuff about Finnish
culture.

In the so-called western society there is a wide-spread idea that we are mostly
from the same cultural background and have same kind of practices and rules of
interaction. This is actually based on the concept that we all grow up with
hollywood movies and US American (I sometimes use the term American when
meaning USA) tv series and that becomes our culture, but it doesn't actually
work like that. As an academic immigrant for nearly a decade now I can well
tell you all that our cultures are in fact very different in very basic every
day fundamental stuff even. And one of the reasons why it goes so wrong is that
both US Americans and Finns who don't travel much and don't interact with
different cultures much do not actually realise how differently we view the US
American entertainment. Like for example, if in tv series *friends* there's a joke
about nudity, both a Finn and American watching the show will laugh at same
thing, but unknowing to each other the Finn will laugh at what they think is
hyperbole of US American people's shame of nudity in all forms, some will learn
that it is not hyperbole over time but many will not; I know this experience is
outdated a bit but there will always be similar happenings in contemporary
entertainment, I believe *Friends* as a comedy series is probably better known
throughout the generations than more modern example (also there is a growing
concensus that *friends* has not aged all too well with regards to it's humour).

## Name calling

In Finland at least how I grew up it is very unusual to call person by name
in a typical conversation, whereas in English-speaking cultures it is not
unusual even when talking one-on-one. So the two situations I can think
of someone calling my name in Finland is:

1. someone is far away in crowded public and trying to catch my attention
  * note however that I do not generally react to my given name since it was
  way too common in Finland when I was growing up
  * I am also not very attentive to such calls to attention and usual don't
  have glasses on and also do not recognise my friends in crowds easily
1. in group discussion a leader or superior might point orders or just assign
  turn to someone by name (teacher, boss, higher ranking officer maybe?)

Therefore if it's friendly discussion among peers (in reasonably uncrowded
place that requires no extra shouting) and someone repeatedly
names me, my first thought will be I done something wrong. I think even in
English this can be used effectively with some extra tones and emphases:
*So, Irene, tell us, what is your solution to the problem, Irene*.

## Please thank you

The politeness levels are one of the most surprising and risky things in
any culture, because there is a huge potential to offend, but also because
such rules of good behaviour are learnt very early in one's lifetime, most
people will hold on to what their parents or guardians taught them very
tightly and assign very strong universality to that.

In English speaking cultures there is a strong rule to always say please
or thank you after most of the interactions with other people, and not
doing so is seen as a purposeful insult. This works with friends and
relatives as well as bartenders in cheap dive bars and expensive fine
dining, no way around it. In Finland, it is nearly impossible to say
*kiitos* (thank you) or *ole hyv√§* (please) without sounding sarcastic
or rude, asking you're friends or relatives for a thing is *anna(tko) X:n*
(gimme(?) X) and I don't think there is a thing to say when you pass
something, or maybe *joo* (yeah), if you say like *saisinko X:n kiitos*
(may I have X please) it really sounds like you are early level language
learner or being rather sarcastic akin to "would you be so kidn
as to entertain the  possibility of passing me the X kind sir please".

Which does remind of another thing in the politeness scale, many languages in
Asia have politeness baked in to the system so strongly that e.g. native
speakers of many Indian languages struggle not addressing people *sir*, with
at least some of the English speakers in UK, Ireland and the USA it invokes the
same kind of weird feeling as thanking about everything does to me as a Finn.

## Nudity

Nudity is not a big deal in Finland, and not sexual per se, just simple as that.
If you are trying to make things sexual by just being nude you probably will
fail with a Finn. If you go to a Finnish sauna you might see nude people
enjoying the sauna and no sex. It's actually too hot for sex in proper sauna
anyways.
