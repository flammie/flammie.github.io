# Flammie on politics

I try to avoid politics as far as I can. I am not interested in politics, I
don't feel competent enough to give my opinion and also due to lack of interest
will not find out enough to participate. This is not particularly acceptable in
modern societies, being interested in politics is considered to be something all
smart people do. There's an old Finnish song that roughly translates "I am too
right-wing for the left-wingers and too fascist for the left-wingers", it gives
an impression. But primarily I am opportunist when I have to, incidentally it
usually sets me in quite left wing, since I often need human rights for myself,
i.e. queers and immigrants, that right wing opposes. You might think that right
wing would support e.g. minority languages of indigenous folks, however it
doesn't seem to happen that often. On the other front, my work with minority
languages is often pulled into political contexts and while I try my best to
avoid it it's not always possible, just to bear in mind if I am forced to speak
of politics related to my work, it was probably not a strong opinion but forced
out of me.

There are of course things that are political and I do have a kind of opinion
that are important for my life, minority languages already mentioned. Here's a
short list of opinions I might defend when in group of friends / drunk,
unpopular opinions if you may, in contemporary internet usage:

* Capitalism especially in its current form is a total failure, I wrote a
  specific rant about it as well on this site, the gap between rich and the poor
  is the worst ever, the products and services we get are not best quality they
  can be, etc. etc.,
* r/fuckcars: the older I get the more I realise car culture has destroyed our
  cities, car drivers murder more people than any other human cause and create
  more pollution that could be avoided
* relatedly I do get more eco conscious getting older in the current climate
  crisis, go support extinction rebellion in that, their mission statement is
  explicitly to not blame individuals which I like, and lets admit it they've
  done in few years what greenpeace has failed and wasted our monies with in
  decades
* nuclear power is part of the solution for sustainable future, there's very
  good scientific evidence on it being most ecological and nearly only FUD
  scaremongering against
* lgbtqia+ movement does lead to better experience for everyone, we are on track
  of getting rid of toxic gender roles, allowing people to dress like they want
  and talk like they want, everyone benefits it's just that simple
* many religions are not compatible with modern societies, seriously, if you
  believe in hurting, slaving or killing people of different genders, sexual
  orientations or other religions it's just not ok, yes you can modernise your
  religion by cherry-picking your holy books, but that's rather untrustworthy
  and unscaleable.
