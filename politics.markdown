# Flammie on politics

I try to avoid politics as far as I can. I am not interested in politics, I
don't feel competent enough to give my opinion and also due to lack of interest
will not find out enough to participate. This is not particularly acceptable in
modern societies, being interested in politics is considered to be something all
smart people do. There's an old Finnish song that roughly translates "I am too
right-wing for the left-wingers and too fascist for the left-wingers", it gives
an impression. Buty primarily I am opportunist when I have to, incidentally it
usually sets me in quite left wing, since I often need human rights for myself,
i.e. queers and immigrants, that right wing opposes. You might think that right
wing would support e.g. minority languages of indigenous folks, however it
doesn't seem to happen that often. On the other front, my work with minority
languages is often pulled into political contexts and while I try my best to
avoid it it's not always possible, just to bear in mind if I am forced to speak
of politics related to my work, it was probably not a strong opinion but forced
out of me.
