# Flammie on academic English

*WIP*

*Academic English* is an idea that there is very specific style of English that
is appropriate for all the academic writing. It still has a lot of support in
academic community: Universities have courses on academic English, some very
prominent academics are supporting it strongly, etc., etc. It only has one
problem. Itâ€™s an elitistic shibboleth, a code that you will be native in if you
have grown up and/or been educated in larger more expensive Western schools. It
has nothing to do with readability or any measurable good style. And it is very
strongly used to keep non-native English speakers out, especially minorities and
underrepresented peoples.

There are a number of silly rules that people have learnt on academic English
courses and meticulously recite in their reviews, and rank down the papers based
on it. Some of them are the basic language rule booking that people tend to do
when they don't understand linguistics but have been taught somethings, in
English this usually amounts to stuff like "prepositions should not be at the
end of the sentence" or "split infinitives" or even worse things like "passive
voice should not be used". Some are more absurd superstitions like "if there's a
germanic and latinate term for same concept you must use the latinate one". A
good one that has been recently popping up in twitter is "you must always use we
even if it's single writer paper".
