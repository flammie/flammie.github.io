# Flammie on workers' rights, or something

It's May Day today and some parts of Europe at least celebrate it as workers'
day or something. It's a weird time for that right now, on one hand we still
have workers' unions in Europe that do participate in politics and at least do
annual salary negotiations, on the other hand, they've just given up and are not
up with the times. Early successes for unions were things like getting 40 hours
work weeks and holidays and extra pay on weekends and whatnot. But now we work
for mobile apps (as self-employed *enterpreneurs*), commute several hours to
work and back, are available and working 24/7, don't bill extra for weekend,
night work, unions have not helped us with any of this. And AI is taking all our
jobs, but not in a good way, as AI makes things more efficient, instead of
coding and writing nice stuff fix code and proof read texts that seem like they
were written by drunken 12-year-old, this is much less fun than actually doing
the work and more demanding. I think, this May Day (or maybe one of the next
ones), we need to start a revolution of Unions 2.0...
